/*
 * Visually hide an element
 *
 * When you hide an element with display: none, that prevents screen readers from reading it to the user.
 * Sometimes thatâ€™s fine, but in other cases this will make the site hard to use for people with screen readers.
 * Thus, we have to use another technique for hiding elements while at the same time make them accessible.
